The purpose of this process is to ensure accuracy, confirm clinical stability, and provide clear educational context in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards. BetterMindCare does not provide medical interpretation and does not determine medical necessity; all clinical review is performed solely by independent clinicians.

        <section id="liquidated—damages">
          <h2>Liquidated Damages (Hybrid)</h2>
          <p>
            For competitors, scrapers, bots, and actors engaging in willful Unauthorized Use, the following liquidated damages apply:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>$25,000 per report or data export copied or shared outside Authorized Use</li>
            <li>$50,000 per model, algorithm, workflow, or scoring methodology copied or derived</li>
            <li>$100,000 per automated scraper, bot, or crawler detected, plus $1,000 per day of continued misuse after notice</li>
            <li>$10,000 per unauthorized account, identity, or device involved</li>

          <p>
            For ordinary customers acting unintentionally or without malicious intent, BetterMindCare may apply reduced remedies or give users the opportunity to cure violations. However, repeated or intentional misuse will trigger full enforcement. Liquidated damages are not a penalty but a reasonable estimate of anticipated harm.
